#Project Charter Template
This is a template for a project charter written in LaTeX, the class and
template were written by S. V. Paulauskas. Descriptions of the sections
were taken from [Project Managment Docs](http://www.projectmanagementdocs.com
"Project Management Docs") as described in their Project-Charter-Long
document. Other information was taken from templates provided by Shane
Colter, PMP through the Practical Project Management Workshop at the
University of Tennessee on August 25, 2015.

##Section Listing
###Project Description
This section provides a high-level description of the project. This 
description should not contain too much detail but should provide general 
information about what the project is, how it will be done, and what it is 
intended to accomplish. As the project moves forward the details will be 
developed, but for the project charter, high-level information is what should 
be provided.

####Project Objectives and Success Criteria
Objectives should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and
Time-bound. The project manager must be able to track these objectives in 
order to determine if the project is on the path to success. Vague, confusing,
and unrealistic objectives make it difficult to measure progress and success.
	
####Assumptions
The project team must identify the assumptions they will be working under as the
project goes forward. These assumptions are what the project manager/team expect
to have or be made available without anyone specifically stating so.

###Scope
The preliminary scope statement is a general paragraph which highlights what the 
project will include, any high-level resource or requirement descriptions, and 
what will constitute completion of the project. This preliminary scope statement 
is exactly that: preliminary. All of this information will be expanded upon in 
greater detail as the project moves forward and undergoes progressive elaboration.

###Deliverables
This section should list all of the deliverables that the customer, project
sponsor, or stakeholders require upon the successful completion of the project.
Every effort must be made to ensure this list includes all deliverables and project
sponsor approval must be required for adding additional deliverables in order to
avoid scope creep.

###Budget and Cost
The summary budget should contain general cost components and their planned costs. 
As the project moves forward these costs may change as all tasks and requirements 
become clearer. Any changes must be communicated by the project manager.

###Project Roles
Here we define the various people currently invovled with the project and their
role.

###Summary Milestone Schedule
This section provides an estimated schedule of all high-level project milestones. 
It is understood that this is an estimate and will surely change as the project 
moves forward and the tasks and milestones and their associated requirements are 
more clearly defined.

###Requirements & Constraints
####Requirements
The project team should develop a list of all high-level project requirements.
These requirements are clear guidelines within which the project must conform 
and may be a result of input from the project sponsor, customer, stakeholders, 
or the project team. 
	
####Constraints
Constraints are restrictions or limitations that the project manager must deal 
with pertaining to people, money, time, or equipment. It is the project 
managerâ€™s role to balance these constraints with available resources in order 
to ensure project success.

###Risks
All projects have some form of risk attached. This section should provide a list
of high-level risks that the project team has determined apply to this project.

###Approval
This is an optional signature field for approval from the project sponsor.
To not use this section you can simply comment the "\approvalsignature"
call.
